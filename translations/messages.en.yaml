        question:
            1:
                title: What does your relocation service include exactly?
                text: Our service covers every step of your relocation, from property search to move-in. It includes property selection, visit organization, lease negotiation and signing, check-in inspection, and the setup of utilities (energy, internet, home insurance). Our goal is to provide a smooth, secure and stress-free relocation experience, with a single dedicated point of contact throughout the process.
            2:
                title: What is the difference between Relocation In Paris and a traditional real estate agency?
                text: A traditional agency works for the landlord and aims to rent its inventory as quickly as possible. We act exclusively on behalf of tenants as apartment hunters. We scan the entire market (agencies, private owners, off-market listings) to find the property that truly matches your criteria and to actively defend your application.
            3:
                title: Do you have access to off-market properties?
                text: Yes. Thanks to our long-standing presence and a network of over 80 partners in Paris and the Île-de-France region, we have access to off-market and pre-listed properties before they are published on major real estate platforms. This is a key advantage in a highly competitive market.
            4:
                title: What happens if you cannot find an apartment?
                text: This situation is extremely rare, as we validate the feasibility of your project before starting any assignment. Since our creation, 100% of our searches have been successful. Until a property is secured, we continue searching or adjust the strategy together. Moreover, 50% of our fees are only due upon success, at lease signing.
            5:
                title: Can I rent a property remotely before arriving in France?
                text: Absolutely. This is one of our core specialties. Most of our clients rent remotely. We visit on your behalf, inspect every detail, provide detailed visit reports and manage the lease signing. You arrive in Paris simply to collect the keys, with complete peace of mind.
            6:
                title: What documents are required to rent an apartment in Paris?
                text: Landlords usually require an ID, the last three payslips, the latest tax notice, proof of current address and an employment certificate. For more complex profiles, we help you build a strong and reassuring application.
            7:
                title: Do you assist freelancers or profiles without a permanent contract?
                text: Yes. We regularly support freelancers, trial-period employees and profiles without permanent contracts. We know how to present these profiles to landlords and insurers and can guide you toward suitable guarantee solutions.
            8:
                title: Do I need a French guarantor?
                text: A guarantor is often required, especially for students and young professionals. If you do not have one, we work with recognized guarantor institutions that can act as a trusted guarantor for Parisian landlords and agencies.
            9:
                title: Do you assist students and shared housing projects?
                text: Yes. We support French and international students as well as shared housing projects. Depending on the strength of the application and defined criteria, we adapt our strategy to identify the best opportunities available.
            10:
                title: How long does it take to find an apartment in Paris?
                text: Once your application file is complete and the mandate signed, the average timeframe is around 20 days. For urgent requests, our responsiveness can sometimes secure a lease in under one week.
            11:
                title: What budget should I expect when renting in Paris?
                text: In 2026, the average budget ranges between €35 and €45 per sqm for quality furnished rentals in central Paris. Studios typically start around €800–900, while one-bedroom apartments range from €1,400–1,700. A precise estimate is provided during our first consultation.
            12:
                title: Which districts are best suited to my profile?
                text: Each Paris district has its own identity. The right choice depends on your lifestyle, work location, family situation and priorities. During our consultation, we guide you toward the districts best suited to your profile.
            13:
                title: Do you offer furnished and unfurnished rentals?
                text: Yes. We search for both furnished and unfurnished properties. Furnished apartments offer flexibility and immediate move-in, while unfurnished properties are better suited for long-term installations.
            14:
                title: What is the minimum lease duration?
                text: For furnished apartments, leases are generally one year renewable. For unfurnished properties, leases are three years. Mobility leases also exist, ranging from 1 to 10 months. In Paris, tenant notice periods are one month.
            15:
                title: Are charges included in the rent?
                text: Rental charges generally include cold water, common area maintenance and elevator costs. Electricity, gas and internet are usually at the tenant’s expense unless a specific all-inclusive package is mentioned.
            16:
                title: How do your fees work?
                text: Our fees are transparent and performance-based. 50% is paid at the start of the mission to activate the search, and the remaining 50% is only due upon success, at lease signing.
            17:
                title: Do your fees include agency fees for the rented property?
                text: Our fees cover exclusively our search and relocation support service. Any agency fees related to the property itself are separate and regulated by law. When renting directly from a private landlord, no additional agency fees apply.
            18:
                title: Do you provide post-move-in support?
                text: Yes. We assist with utility activation, internet installation and home insurance, and remain available to support your settlement after arrival.
            19:
                title: Do you assist with visa or residence permit procedures?
                text: We work with specialized immigration partners and can coordinate your housing setup alongside your administrative procedures to ensure a smooth arrival in France.

                text: Using a relocation agency saves time, secures recruitment and ensures a smooth arrival for talents. An employee struggling with housing is stressed and less productive. By delegating this mission, you enhance your employer brand and free HR teams from time-consuming administrative tasks.
            2:
                title: What is the cost of the service for the company?
                text: Our services are based on customized quotations. Pricing depends on mission complexity and volume. This cost should be viewed as an investment, far lower than the cost of a failed recruitment or early resignation due to housing issues.
            3:
                title: Is the service paid by the company or the employee?
                text: This depends on your HR policy. Most companies cover relocation fees as part of the onboarding package, while others reimburse expenses or opt for partial coverage. We adapt to your internal processes.
            4:
                title: What workload does this represent for HR teams?
                text: Almost none. Once connected with the employee, we manage the entire process. HR teams receive regular reporting without operational involvement.
            5:
                title: Do you work with startups and small companies?
                text: Yes. Whether it is your first international hire or multiple relocations per year, our service adapts. For startups, relocation is often a decisive factor in attracting international talent.
            6:
                title: Do you manage international employee arrivals?
                text: Yes. This is our core expertise. We act as a trusted third party to secure applications, reassure landlords and ensure a smooth installation in Paris.
            7:
                title: Do you support employees’ families as well?
                text: Yes. Successful mobility includes the entire family. We assist with school searches, daycare enrollment and spouse integration.

                text: We cover Paris intra-muros as well as the entire inner and outer suburbs, optimizing commute times.
            12:
                title: How are HR teams informed about progress?
                text: We work autonomously with employees while providing HR with regular updates at each key stage, ensuring visibility without workload.
            13:
                title: Do you manage interns and junior profiles?
                text: Yes. Through partnerships with residences and private landlords, we provide adapted solutions for interns and junior professionals.
            14:
                title: How does billing work?
                text: A 50% deposit is paid at mission launch, with the remaining 50% due only upon success. Periodic billing can be arranged for high volumes.

            17:
                title: Do you assist with utilities and internet setup?
                text: Yes. Employees arrive in fully operational homes with electricity, gas and internet active.
            18:
                title: How do you ensure data confidentiality?
                text: Confidentiality is absolute. Only strictly necessary information is shared through secure channels. Enhanced discretion protocols apply for sensitive profiles.
            19:
                title: Do you have professional insurance?
                text: Yes. We hold Professional Civil Liability insurance covering all advisory and search activities.

                title: Do I have to rent my property furnished?

                title: What are the benefits of a civil code lease?
                text: Civil code leases provide greater contractual flexibility and enhanced security, as the tenant is a legal entity rather than an individual.
